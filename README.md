### What the project is about
This project is about virtual painting. It utilizes my laptop's webcam and filters out specific colors so I can draw on screen using them. 
I chose the colors red, blue, and green because they were generally the furthest away from each other and the easiest to distinguish visually. It also made it easier to pick the color values when converted to HSV. 

Red however was especially challenging to work with, since anything with a reddish tint like my hand, wall, or shirt was being recognized and caused a lot of noise. 
Generally however the project somehwat does what it is intended to do.
